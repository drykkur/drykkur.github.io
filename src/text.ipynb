    "New York City is one of the busiest cities in the world, with millions of residents and visitors relying on its extensive network of roads and highways to go about their daily lives. With so many vehicles on the roads, accidents are an unevitable but much too common occurrence. These accidents can have serious consequences, ranging from property damage to severe injuries and sadly also fatalities.\n",
    "Data can be a powerful tool for understanding and addressing the patterns of these collisions, and we are going to be analyzing a dataset about [Motor Vehicle Collisions in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95), to identify patterns and trends that could help prevent future accidents and improve road safety. This dataset contains extensive information about the circumstances surrounding the collisions, including the locations and times of incidents and also the contributing factors and types of vehicles involved.\n",
    "This extensive dataset allows us to uncover insights such as seasonal and geographical trends. Additionally, we can make recommendations such as the safest places to drive and whether or not improvements have been made over the years.\n",
    "So follow along as we uncover the story behind trafic collisions in NYC, and try to work towards a safer transportation system for the city."

    "From the plot above, we see multiple interesting things. First of all, Brooklyn seems to be highly exposed to serious consequences following a collision, as the number of fatalities and especially injuries is very high. It is by far the borough that is most prone to injuries, as 36.09% of those are happening here. \n",
    "Brooklyn is closely followed by Queens, which is sadly overrepresented in fatalities when comparing to the number of collisions and injuries. \n",

    "When interpreting these results, we should consider the types of accidents that each of the boroughs are prone to as a result of the circumstances surrounding them.\n",
    "We see that there is certainly a clear overrepresentation of fatalities in the two boroughs Brooklyn and Queens. In addition to having the most residents, both boroughs have a higher number of major roads, such as highways. This likely means that accidents happen at higher speeds, which can increase the likelihood of severe accidents. The opposite may apply to Manhattan, where the roads are generally much smaller and the amount of traffic is so heavy that going at high speed is almost impossible. The high number of vehicles might be the cause of the many collisions, while the slow speed can be why fewer of them result in injuries and fatalities."

    "One thing that really stands out in all of these plots, is the afct that the number of collisions drop drastically in the year 2020 for all boroughs. Not surprising, this is the effect of the Covid19 pandemic, where the roads were left near empty in a long period of time. What is more surprising is the fact that the number of collisions is kept low in the years following the lockdown. A possible explanation for this is that a lot of people were working from home and did not need to commute to work, and also that there were very few tourists in the city in the following years.\n",

Based on [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/nyregion/nyc-traffic-deaths.html), it seems that many people, including young and inexperienced drivers, turned to the roads for a feeling of freedom.
